		Efr&eacute;n's research is on Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence, developing theory and algorithms for ML tasks involving complex data. E studies the fair and ethical use of algorithms in an automated society. In particular, how harmful social structures can be reproduced and amplified by implementation of AI in social systems. E engages with art and performance to both bring ideas to the public and to challenge our rotten econo-political system from an aesthetic perspective. Efr&eacute;n likes tacos, tacos likes Efr&eacute;n.</p>

		Margaretha Haughwout's creative work is a kind of multispecies worlding - a phrase introduced by Donna Haraway, who understands it to be the "patterning of possible worlds, a co-becoming that occurs through entanglements with other species. Haughwout collaborates with humans, and the more-than-human across technologies to enact possible worlds - worlds that generate abundance, presence and relationship - and in doing so, antagonize proprietary regimes, colonial temporalities, and capitalist forms of labor. Installation, participatory event, walking tour, experimental pedagogy, intervention, speculative fabulation, and biological processes articulate stages of her worlding processes.</p>

		Suzanne Husky is a French-American artist who questions how humans engage with nature, from prehistory to present day. Using sculpture, installation, photography and film, she looks at our relations with plants, animals, and the earth and how we interact together in poetic and political ways. She received an MFA from Beaux-Arts de Bordeaux, as well as advanced certifications in landscape design from Merritt College in Oakland, and has studied at CCA in San Francisco and at University Michel de Montaigne in France.</p>
